Or, you could use this to estimate the degree of overfitting.\n",

You could also use this as a final step after the model is finalized (often called evaluating the model against a **validation set**).\n",

    "The most common workflow is actually a combination of train/test split and cross-validation. We take a train/test split on our data right away and try not spend a lot of time using the testing data set. Instead, we take our training data and tune our models using cross-validation. When we think we are done, we do one last test on the testing data to make sure we haven't accidently overfit to our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you tune hyperparameters via cross-validation, you should never use cross-validation on the same dataset to estimate OOS accuracy!** Using cross-validation in this way, the entire dataset was used to tune hyperparameters. So, this invalidates our condition above -- where we assumed the test set is a pretend \"out-of-sample\" dataset that was not used to train our model! So, we would expect the accuracy on this test set to be artificially inflated as compared to actual \"out-of-sample\" data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with good evaluation procedures, it is incredible easy to overfit our models by including features that will not be available during production or leak information about our testing data in other ways."
